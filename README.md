# 07-2D-Platformer

Bounce Up! is a side scrolling 2D platformer that was created for a project in Godot for the Game Technology course at Indiana University.
Don't get hit by the blobs as they try to stop you from stealing all their coins! Use their squishy heads to bounce up and over their grasp and claim as many coins as you can.

Currently contains two levels and Play and Quit buttons. Save and Load buttons are implemented but the do not currently function.
